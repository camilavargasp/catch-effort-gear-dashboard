# Fishing Gear Plastic Project Dashboard

This App is the result of a larger project that uses an industrial ecology approach  to quantify how much derelict gear goes into the ocean yearly.

Here we show the catch-effort relationship for each fishing gear type as reported by [Global Fishing Watch (GFW)](https://globalfishingwatch.org/).

We used [Perez-Roda et al (2019)](http://www.fao.org/fishery/static/TP633/datarepository.xlsm) to assign each species reported on the FAO landings into a logical fishery. Each fishery has a specific gear type that was then mapped into one of the GFW vessel type. In the dashboard we present each of the industrial fisheries per country that was mapped into a GFW vessel type and the observed effort.

Finally, we you can also explore how much of the catch of each species is allocated to each logical fishery.
